# D.I.Wire
CNC Wirebender Project


My cousin Cyrus is a fisherman, and he his family has been selling a bait snap for the past 20+ years. His grandfather built the machine that he previously used to create the snaps. Unfortunately the machibe broke and he no longer has the knowledge to put it back together. So Cyrus asked me to help. I've been in the process of designing a CNC wirebender based off of Pensa's D.I Wirebender project.
